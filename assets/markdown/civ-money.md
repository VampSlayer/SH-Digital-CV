CivMoney was born out of the game Civilization. In Civilization you must be careful that your expenses for your empire are lower than your income. If you spend more than you earn you go into the red.

With CivMoney you can manage your income and expenses with rich visualizations showing whether you saved, lost or broke even for that day, month and year. Try to save more than you spend to stay in the green or you will end up in the red.

Sayam created CivMoney in 2015. With version one written using Ruby and Sinatra for the API, and a vanilla JavaScript front end. CivMoney was Sayam's first attempt at building a full stack application outside of a professional environment. He kept the Ruby API and iterated over the front end. Version two of the front end was written in React, with the current version in Vue.js. A .Net Core port of the API has also been created.
