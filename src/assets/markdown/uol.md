##### Master's of Physics (MPhys) 2:1

During Sayam's Masters he gained and developed skills and techniques in report writing, experimental techniques, data analysis, complex maths, grant proposals, problem solving, scientific research, electronics, product development and effective display of information. 

He completed and excelled in many modules especially in modules involving modelling physical phenomena and electronics where he used Matlab and Java. Due to Sayamâ€™s skills and enjoyment in those programming modules he chose a physical modeling Masters project. The project utilized the parallelization capabilities of graphics processing units using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), developed by NVIDIA, and C. The key challenge was the required time in which the large number of small computations of linear algebra, eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation of 3x3 matrices, could be completed in. Thus the use of the graphics processing unit which is designed for small parallel computations. 

A poster created for this project of the method and findings can be found on the next tab.
