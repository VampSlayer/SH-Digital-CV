##### Digital Workplace Integrations

Sayam developed, a number of microservices to handle third partyâ€™s APIs and an orchestration layer with which the main intranet could interface. The microservices used .NET Core 2.1 with a Vue.js front end and DynamoDB for persistence. All of these services used continuous integration and deployment with high test coverages. The biggest challenge was to create decoupled microservices and develop away from the main product, which had many legacy issues and a slow deployment and development process. Sayam was able to develop a framework for these third party integrations to be developed and deployed quickly.

##### Employee Pulse Surveys

Sayam and his team created a surveying tool which allowed employers to ask their employees a small number of questions often, allowing them to get a pulse of the employee regularly. Sayam designed Pulse Surveys using microservice and front end agnostic architecture with AWS resources. Sayam made use of .NET Core 2.2, Vue.js, AWS Aurora DB and AWS lambda serverless functions to complete the project, releasing iteratively and often.
