Sayam obtained a work and travel visa for Canada in 2019 and decided to move to the west coast of Canada. He found a developer position at Momentum Dashboard (the most popular new tab extension for Chrome and Firefox with a user base of over 3 million), a product that he uses everyday. Sayam wanted to develop and add value to a product that is passionate about the user experience.

Sayam joined a small team, and implemented many changes to improve the teams performance after he observed many inefficiencies. Sayam brought an iterative approach to development and features, as well as more defined sprints, clearer specifications, estimations, and regular retrospectives.

Sayam was involved in bringing an ageing front end up to date using Vue.Js, which allowed the team to iterate and add features to the product quicker than they were able to with the legacy backbone.js frontend.Sayam was also involved in creation and use of Github Actions to automate many tasks, such as extension release pipeline, automatic commenting on  JIRA issues on PR, CI testing pipelines using Cypress and more.

As this company was small, Sayam had many roles beyond that of just a developer and was able to use his experience in guiding a relatively junior team of developers to become more agile, efficient and productive.
